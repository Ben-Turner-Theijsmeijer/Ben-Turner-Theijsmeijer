# Hi, I’m @Ben-Turner-Theijsmeijer
- My passion is creation: wether it be building computer programs, games, art, stories, or something else, tinkering is my lifelong purpose.
- I'm a recent gradaute from the University of Guelph's Software Engineering Co-Op Program (2025).
- I work on personal projects rather speratically, usually in week or two long bursts when a new fixation reveals itself.
